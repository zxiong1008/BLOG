                    After graduation, my collegues spoke to me about Coder Foundry, a well-reputatable bootcamp
                    which offers full-stack .net development. I was very fortunate to get accepted into this
                    bootcamp because I did not applied 3 weeks before the course began. Instead, I applied 1 week
                    prior to the start date, and normally students would not get accepted at this time.
                    Fortunately, there was a student who changed seats from this session, to the next coming up one.
                    And it was thanks to Hasim and Andrew that I am here at Coder Foundry today accessing
                    an incredible resource of information.

                    the William States Lee College of Engineering at UNC Charlotte. Then the folowing semester, I applied for
                    a dual degree in Computer and Electrial Engineering. This pushed me to challenge myself and my limitations.

                                    After graduation, my collegues spoke to me about Coder Foundry, a well-reputatable bootcamp
                                    which offers full-stack .net development. I was very fortunate to get accepted into this
                                    bootcamp because I did not applied 3 weeks before the course began. Instead, I applied 1 week
                                    prior to the start date, and normally students would not get accepted at this time.
                                    Fortunately, there was a student who changed seats from this session, to the next coming up one.
                                    And it was thanks to Hasim and Andrew that I am here at Coder Foundry today accessing
                                    an incredible resource of information.

                                    Came to UNC Charlotte with with no clue where I belong. After the first semester, I felt that connection
                                    and interest with coding using C++, so I persued it. Then a year later, I got accepted into
                                    the William States Lee College of Engineering at UNC Charlotte. Then the folowing semester, I applied for
                                    a dual degree in Computer and Electrial Engineering. This pushed me to challenge myself and my limitations.
                                    After 4 years of enduring studious nights at the library, and work on the weekends,
                                    I am proud to say that I've graduated UNC Charlotte with a Bachelor's Degree of Science in Computer Engineering and
                                    a Bachelor's  Degree of Science in Electrical Engineering, which are both ABET accredited.

                                    After a recession, my family and I moved to North Carolina seeking better opportunties.
                                    We started our own family business of growing and sellings flowers at the Farmers Market.
                                    We assist in any floral arrangements varying from house warming events to wedding.
